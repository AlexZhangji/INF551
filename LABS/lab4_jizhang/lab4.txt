1. Find the different (unique) cuisines of "Burger King".
db.restaurants.distinct("cuisine", {"name":/Burger King/i})

2. Find restaurants (output their names only) whose name
contains "King" (matching is case-insensitive). Output
first 10 results (duplicates are ok).

# does this have to be unique names??
db.restaurants.find({"name":/.*King.*/i}, {"name":1, "_id":0} ).limit(10)


3. Find the number of cuisines whose category is not
"Other".
db.restaurants.find({"cuisine":{$ne:"Other"}} ).count()


4. Find the number of Chinese and American cuisines (that
is, either Chinese or American. No need to count
"Chinese/Japanese", etc.)

db.restaurants.find({
$or:
    [
        {"cuisine":"Chinese"},
        {"cuisine":"American"}
    ]
}).count()


5. For each cuisine with at least 1000 restaurants, output
the cuisine and the number of restaurants of the cuisine.

db.restaurants.aggregate(
[{$group:
    {
        _id: "$cuisine",
        num_restaurants:{$sum:1}
    }
 },
 {$match:
    {num_restaurants: {$gte: 1000}}
 }
])
